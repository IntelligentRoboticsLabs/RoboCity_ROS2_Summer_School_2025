    <h2>About the Summer School</h2>
    <p>
      The programme combines theoretical and practical training in ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), Artificial Intelligence, and Field Robotics.
      Teaching activities are led by researchers from the main universities and research centres of Madrid: Universidad Rey Juan Carlos (URJC),
      Universidad de Alcalá (UAH), Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM), Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (UAM), Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM),
      Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (UC3M), and the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC).

    <h2>Programme</h2>
    <p>
      Throughout five days, participants progress from the fundamentals of ROS 2 to the application of AI techniques across different domains of field robotics.
      The schedule below is indicative and may be refined.
    </p>

    <div class="grid" aria-label="Daily programme">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Day 1 – Fundamentals of ROS 2 and introductory concepts</h3>
        <p>
          Technical foundations of the course: ROS 2 ecosystem and architecture, nodes, topics, and development tools. Hands-on exercises include
          environment setup, inter-process communication, and basic simulation workflows.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Day 2 – Autonomous vehicles</h3>
        <p>
          Perception, planning, and control for intelligent vehicles: modular architectures, AI-based perception and decision-making, and integration
          with realistic simulators. Practical sessions cover machine-learning and navigation algorithms in virtual environments.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Day 3 – Quadruped robots</h3>
        <p>
          Legged robotics: dynamic control, stability, and locomotion strategies for quadruped platforms. Sessions combine theory, demonstrations,
          and experiments in simulation and on real robots, including current AI trends in locomotion and behaviour learning.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Day 4 – Agricultural robotics and natural environments</h3>
        <p>
          Field robotics for agricultural, inspection, and environmental monitoring tasks. Topics include operation in unstructured environments,
          variable perception conditions, sensor integration, flexible manipulation, and distributed control.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Day 5 – Final project and closing session</h3>
        <p>
          Presentation of ROS 2 projects developed throughout the week. Student teams showcase results and share insights, followed by a discussion,
          diploma ceremony, and closing event.

    <h2>Learning Approach</h2>
    <p>
      The pedagogical approach is practical and collaborative. Participants learn by doing, combining knowledge of AI, control, and perception with
      direct implementation in ROS 2, in both simulators and real robotic platforms. Beyond its technical dimension, the school promotes intercultural
      collaboration and international teamwork, fostering a dynamic environment for learning and experimentation.
